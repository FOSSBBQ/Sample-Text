# Sample-Text
A Fully Open Source Text Editor written in Rust designed to be the meeting-point of simplicity and ability. Sample-Text is designed to be easy to use, customizable, and easy to extend, but does not give up usability and portability! Sample-Text can be used in the terminal as nano or vim would be, but contains all the features your favorite GUI editor supplies.
